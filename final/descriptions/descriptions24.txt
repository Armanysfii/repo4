1 "The 1955 Harley Davidson Hummer sports an air-cooled, two-stroke, 125cc, single cylinder engine mated to a three-speed manual transmission and can produce 3 horsepower. It was a minimalist machine, suitable for riders who wanted a fuel-efficient, dependable and agile daily commuter. A telescopic fork, a spring-mounted solo seat, laved wheels, a 1.75-gallon fuel tank, a simple handlebar and a single exhaust pipe, are a part of the features it comes standard with.",
