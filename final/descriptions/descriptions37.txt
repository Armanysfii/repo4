1 "The 1977 Harley Davidson XLCR 1000 Café Racer has, at its heart, an air-cooled, four-stroke, 45° V-Twin powerhouse mated to a five-speed manual transmission and can produce 68 horsepower and 81 Nm of torque. 


It boasts one of the most unique designs in the House Milwaukee line-up, and, as the name suggests it has been inspired from cafe racers, with a minimalist and simple design. Nevertheless, this machine is sure to stand out in any crowd, thanks to its blacked-out elements, which are sure to fit the taste for those riders who want a more aggressive machine.",
