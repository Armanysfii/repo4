1 "Part of the Softail category, the 2018 Harley-Davidson FXDR 114 has been designed using plenty of alloy and composite components to reduce the bike's weight, including an all-new aluminum swingarm and subframe. A 2-into-1 exhaust system has been tuned to output the classic H-D throaty rumble at almost all revs from the Milwakee-Eight 114 engine.",
